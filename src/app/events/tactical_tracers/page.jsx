          Line follower robots, using infrared sensors, autonomously track lines
          on the ground. Components include microcontrollers, motors, sensors,
          and a power source. Applications span warehouses, education,
          entertainment, and research. They aid in material handling, serve as
          teaching tools, and feature in robotics competitions, promoting
          innovation and learning. These robots hold promise for practical use
          and education as technology advances.
